## Mbed OS build tools

### Mbed CLI 2
Starting with version 6.5, Mbed OS uses Mbed CLI 2. It uses Ninja as a build system, and CMake to generate the build environment and manage the build process in a compiler-independent manner. If you are working with Mbed OS version prior to 6.5 then check the section [Mbed CLI 1](#mbed-cli-1).
1. [Install Mbed CLI 2](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/latest/build-tools/install-or-upgrade.html).
1. From the command-line, import the example: `mbed-tools import mbed-os-example-blinky`
1. Change the current directory to where the project was imported.

### Mbed CLI 1
1. [Install Mbed CLI 1](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/latest/quick-start/offline-with-mbed-cli.html).
1. From the command-line, import the example: `mbed import mbed-os-example-blinky`
1. Change the current directory to where the project was imported.



## Building and running

1. Connect a USB cable between the USB port on the board and the host computer.
1. Run the following command to build the example project and program the microcontroller flash memory:

    * Mbed CLI 2

    ```bash
    $ mbed-tools compile -m <TARGET> -t <TOOLCHAIN> --flash
    ```

    * Mbed CLI 1

    ```bash
    $ mbed compile -m <TARGET> -t <TOOLCHAIN> --flash
    ```

Your PC may take a few minutes to compile your code.

The binary is located at:
* **Mbed CLI 2** - `./cmake_build/<TARGET>/develop/<TOOLCHAIN>/mbed-os-example-blinky.bin`
* **Mbed CLI 1** - `./BUILD/<TARGET>/<TOOLCHAIN>/mbed-os-example-blinky.bin`

Alternatively, you can manually copy the binary to the board, which you mount on the host computer over USB.
